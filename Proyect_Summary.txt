Hypothesis: A central bank’s communication should be consistent with the level of interest rates in the economy. Furthermore, it should also help markets anticipate future changes to such interest rates. 

Key questions:

- Is the central bank communication consistent with its policy stance
- Do policy statements allow us to infer enough information about it?
- Is analyzing words (counting words) in those statements of any help?
- Can statements provide data not only of present, but also future rates?

Why should we care?

- Inflation is a regressive tax, and can have damaging consequences
- Efficient communication helps CBs keep inflation expectations of check
- This also allows economic agents to take better decisions

Data needs: 

- Access to Mexico central bank’s (Banxico) statements
- Data on interest rates and foreign exchange (peso)
- Statements are available in Banxico’s website…but just in PDF!
- Data, in contrast, are provided through Banxico’s free API 

Data Processing: 

- We use PDFMiner to read and convert statements into text files that can be manipulated 
- Once converted into text and split by words, we clean the data, removing unnecessary words 
- We then use word counting to seek for key frases (inflation, growth, risks, volatility, etc) in the statement
- We convert the obtained information into a DataFrame
- Finally, using Banxico's API we request data on interest and FX levels teh day of the statement and the day after, and create a DF
- This allows us to compare interest rates and interest rate changes to central bank communication and test their consistency 

Findings: 

- There is a strong correlation between Banxico's communication (word counts) and interest rate levels
- There is also a strong correlation between communication and future changes in interest rates 

Conclusions
- Inflation is damaging in many ways, not least by acting as a regressive tax 
- An efficient central bank communication helps contain inflation
- A central bank that reacts predictably to economic data should be more efficient
- Data analytics provide tools to test such efficiency 
- We find that analyzing words used in CBs statements help predict rates…
…and not only current rates, but future rates too!
- This is important as efforts to communicate clearly seem to pay off…at least if you know where to search for
- Correctly interpreting a CB’s communication can help improve the economy’s functioning
