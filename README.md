# Team Members:

# Description
Using The API from Mexico central bank (BANXICO), we will be able to extract data from its communications in order to obtain a real time approximation of banxico´s future policy stance (level or interest rate) and compare it to market expectations.

# Reserch questions. 
1. How can we extract a signal on the level of interest rate from the banks policy statements?
2. How does this compares to market expectations about the level of rates?ç
3. Is there a correlations between the index we intend to build with rate market real time reaction?
4. Is there a correlations between the index we intend to build with usd/mxn market real time reaction?

# Database:
Banxico's API

# Rough breakdown of tasks 
1. Retrieve statements (data) from the central bank's API and financial markets data from Bloomberg
2. Clean data 
3. Build command to comapre any pair of statements
4. Extract key words from any particular statement 
5. Use key words to build index that signals higher or lower interest rates 
6. Compare the signal from the index to market expectations on interst rates 
7. Caluclate the correlation between the index from a particular statement and compare to real-time market reaction
